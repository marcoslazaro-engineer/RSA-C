# RSA-C
This repository contains two programs for RSA encryption and decryption:

rsa_profesional.c - Generates RSA keys, encrypts messages, and decrypts them

rsadesci.c - Decrypts messages using a private key file

The implementation uses OpenSSL's RSA functions with 4096-bit keys and PKCS#1 v1.5 padding.

## Technical Details
Key Generation
Key length: 4096 bits (RSA_KEYLEN)

Public exponent (e): 65537 (RSA_PUB_EXP)

Primes: Two large prime numbers (p and q) generated by OpenSSL's RSA_generate_key_ex()

Modulus (N): p * q (4096-bit product of the two primes)

Private exponent (d): Computed as the modular inverse of e mod φ(N), where φ(N) = (p-1)(q-1)

## Encryption Parameters
Maximum message length: 501 bytes (for 4096-bit keys with PKCS#1 v1.5 padding)

Ciphertext length: 512 bytes (4096 bits)

Padding scheme: PKCS#1 v1.5 (RSA_PKCS1_PADDING)
## Key Storage
Private keys are saved in PEM format to clave_privada.pem
Public keys are displayed in PEM format during generation
## Usage
ENCRYPTION:
gcc rsa_profesional.c -o rsa_profesional -lcrypto

./rsa_profesional

The program will:
Generate a new RSA key pair

Display the public key in PEM format

Prompt for a message to encrypt

Show the encrypted message in hex format

Decrypt the message and display it

Save the private key to clave_privada.pem
---------------------------------------------------
DECRYPTION: 
gcc rsadesci.c -o rsa_dec -lcrypto

./rsa_descifrado clave_privada.pem [hex_encrypted_message]

## RECOMMENDATION ( IMPORTANT)
 This is a realistic usage of RSA encryption but THIS IMPLEMENTATION IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PROFESSIONAL OR PRODUCTION USE because:

It has not been tested against side-channel attacks (timing attacks, power analysis, etc.)

It lacks comprehensive security auditing

Memory management could be improved to prevent potential leaks
